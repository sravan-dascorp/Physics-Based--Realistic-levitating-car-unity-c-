# Physics-Based--Realistic-levitating-car-unity-c-
a  levitating car script with for unity.


This is a realistically behaving hovercraft script.put this into a  a game object in unity and make 4 empty gameobjects to act as suspention/thrusters for realistic floating effect.it also have a main booster script .also make sure thre center off mass is a little bit below the main booster for much more realistic wobbling effect and for making it lean when going forward..
